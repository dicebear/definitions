# DiceBear Definitions

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is still in beta stage and will only be used in future versions
> of DiceBear.

This repository contains all official avatar style definitions for
[DiceBear](https://www.dicebear.com). An avatar style definition is a JSON file
that describes how to create an avatar. It contains all necessary information
like available elements and colors. The JSON files are ideal for creating
avatars in different programming languages with the corresponding DiceBear
wrapper. The JSON schema for the avatar style definitions can be found in the
[`@dicebear/schema`](https://github.com/dicebear/schema) package.

## Generate definitions

Most of the JSON files were created using the
[DiceBear Exporter](https://www.dicebear.com/guides/create-an-avatar-style-with-figma/)
for Figma. The used Figma files are linked in the `figma` folder. Files created
with this plugin are marked accordingly and should not be adjusted manually, but
exported again with the Figma plugin.

## Usage

**JavaScript**

```js
import adventurer from '@dicebear/definitions/adventurer.json' assert { type: 'json' };
import lorelei from '@dicebear/definitions/lorelei.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

**PHP**

```php
$basePath = \Composer\InstalledVersions::getInstallPath('dicebear/definitions');

$adventurer = json_decode(file_get_contents($basePath . '/src/adventurer.json'), true);
$lorelei    = json_decode(file_get_contents($basePath . '/src/lorelei.json'), true);
```
